# PHP Assignment 2 - SportsPro Technical Support

This project is a web-based technical support system developed using PHP and MySQL. It features distinct login areas for administrators, technicians, and customers, each with session-based authentication and role-specific access. The application is designed to run on XAMPP with Apache and MySQL, and includes a SQL script to initialize the database. The project structure is organized into folders such as `admin`, `technician_manager`, `customer`, `model`, and `view` for better modularity and maintainability.

## How to Run

1. Import the provided `techsupport.sql` file into your MySQL database.
2. Place the project folder inside your XAMPP `htdocs` directory.
3. Start Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel.
4. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost/PHP_Assignment_2/tech_support/`.
